Selling Software Projecthub offers software products or solutions to clients. These software products could be anything from applications, tools,
or systems tailored to the specific needs of your clients.
Creating College Projects: Project_hub also provides college projects to students. These projects are likely to be academic assignments or 
real-world projects that students can work on to gain practical experience and knowledge.
Client-Project Renewal: After a client purchases a software product or project from Project_hub, there seems to be a renewal process.
This could mean that clients have the option to renew their software licenses or extend their access to college projects for a specific period.
